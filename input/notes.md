# Example Notes

This is a markdown file with some notes about the AI agent project.

## Features

The AI agent provides several key features:

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and custom endpoints
- **Flexible File Processing**: Handles multiple text file formats
- **Recursive Scanning**: Can process files in subdirectories
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time response streaming
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration

## Usage

The agent can be used in several ways:

1. Command-line interface for quick processing
2. Programmatic API for integration into other projects
3. Batch processing for handling multiple files

## Configuration

Configuration is handled through environment variables or a `.env` file, making it easy to customize the agent's behavior without modifying code.

## Conclusion

This demonstrates markdown processing capabilities and shows how the agent can handle structured text content with formatting.
